## About
This repository contains lists of Discord UIDs known to belong to troublemakers or outright malicious actors. The purpose of these lists is to allow server moderators to share information about badly behaving accounts with each other. Moderators can use these lists to decide whether to ban a user from ever joining the server they moderate. Below are the following lists and descriptions:
### extermination.csv
This list contains UIDs of users known to be malicious. These include, but are not limited to, hackers, scammers, spammers, predators, and spies.
### annoyance.csv
This list contains the UIDs of users who are not outright malicious but are repeated rule breakers and general annoyances to the staff. It is highly subjective and should only be used as a heads-up.
### evaluation.csv
This list contains submitted entries that the repository's maintainers are evaluating. Please use this list to submit UIDs to be added, updated, or removed.
### removed.csv
This list contains the UIDs of users removed from the other lists for various reasons.
